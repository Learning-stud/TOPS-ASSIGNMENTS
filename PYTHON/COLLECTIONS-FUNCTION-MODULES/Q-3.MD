# Diffrence Between [append() and ectend()] Methods?

## Answer=> Extend and Append are two Python list methods used to add elements to a list. Although they appear similar, they have different functionalities and use cases. Understanding the differences between the append() and extend() methods is crucial when working with lists in Python. Although both techniques are used to add elements to a list, their behaviors and effects vary. We will examine the distinctions between append() and extend(), how they are used, and when to pick one over the other in this post.

## # Example OF APPEND

```


Python’s append() function inserts a single element into an existing list. The element will be added to the end of the old list rather than being returned to a new list. Adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. The length of the list increases by one.

my_list = ['JAY', 'is']
my_list.append('JAY')
print my_list

output['JAY','is','JAY']


```

## #EXAMPLE OF EXTEND

```
The Python’s List extend() Iterates over its argument and adding each element to the list and extending the list. The length of the list increases by a number of elements in its argument.

list = ['JAY','IS','BORN','IN' ]
lis_to_add= [1,9,9,9]
list.extend(lis_to_add)
print(list)

```
