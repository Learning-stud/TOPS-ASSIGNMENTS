 # A list is a versatile and mutable data structure that allows you to store a collection of items.

#Lists are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets [] and separating them with commas.

#Lists  contain elements of different data types, and we can perform various operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements in a list.


# by using reverse method []



my_list=[1,2,3,4,5]

my_list.reverse()
print("Reversed List",my_list)
