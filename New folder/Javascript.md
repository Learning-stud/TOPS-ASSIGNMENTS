1. **What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add interactivity and dynamic features to websites. It is primarily used for client-side web development, where it runs on the user's web browser.

2. **What is the use of `isNaN` function?**
The `isNaN` function is used to determine if a value is "Not-a-Number" (NaN). It takes a single argument and returns `true` if the argument is not a valid number, and `false` otherwise. This function is often used to validate user input or check if a value is numeric.

3. **What is negative Infinity?**
Negative Infinity is a special numeric value in JavaScript that represents a value that is lower than any other number. It is typically the result of mathematical operations that result in an overflow or underflow. For example, dividing a negative number by zero will result in negative infinity.

4. **Which company developed JavaScript?**
JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation, specifically by Brendan Eich. It was originally released as LiveScript in 1995 but was later renamed to JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.

5. **What are undeclared and undefined variables?**
- Undeclared variables are variables that have not been declared or defined anywhere in the code. If you try to use an undeclared variable, it will result in a ReferenceError.
- Undefined variables, on the other hand, are variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value. When you try to access the value of an undefined variable, it will return the value `undefined`.

6. **Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?**
```javascript
// Create a new element
var newElement = document.createElement('div');

// Set attributes or properties for the element
newElement.id = 'myElement';
newElement.textContent = 'This is a new element';

// Append the new element to an existing element
var existingElement = document.getElementById('existingElement');
existingElement.appendChild(newElement);
```

7. **What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?**
- ViewState is used to store and manage the state of a web page across postbacks. It is encoded and stored in a hidden field on the web page and is sent back and forth between the server and the client.
- SessionState is used to store and manage user-specific data across multiple requests from the same user. The SessionState data is stored on the server and is associated with a unique session ID for each user.

8. **What is the `===` operator?**
The `===` operator in JavaScript is called the strict equality operator. It compares two values for equality without performing type coercion. It checks both the value and the type of the operands. If both the value and the type are the same, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

9. **How can the style/class of an element be changed?**
To change the style/class of an element using JavaScript, you can manipulate the `classList` property or directly modify the `style` property of the element. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Changing the class of an element
var element = document.getElementById('myElement');
element.className = 'newClass';

// Changing the style of an element
var element = document.getElementById('myElement');
element.style.color = 'red';
```

10. **How to read and write a file using JavaScript?**
In a web browser environment, JavaScript doesn't have direct access to the file system for security reasons. However, you can interact with files using JavaScript in other environments such as Node.js, where file system APIs are available. In Node.js, you can use the `fs` module to read and write files.

11. **What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?**
JavaScript provides several looping structures:
- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop
- `for...in` loop (used for iterating over object properties)
- `for...of` loop (used for iterating over iterable objects like arrays)

12. **How can you convert a string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?**
JavaScript provides the `parseInt` function to convert a string representation of a number in a specified base to an integer. For example, to convert a binary string to an integer, you can use:

```javascript
var binaryString = "101010";
var decimalNumber = parseInt(binaryString, 2); // base 2
```

13. **What is the function of the delete operator?**
The `delete` operator in JavaScript is used to delete properties from objects or elements from an array. It allows you to remove a specific property or element and free up memory.

14. **What are all the types of pop-up boxes available in JavaScript?**
JavaScript provides three types of pop-up boxes:
- `alert`: Displays a simple message box with an OK button.
- `confirm`: Displays a message box with OK and Cancel buttons. It returns `true` if the user clicks OK and `false` if the user clicks Cancel.
- `prompt`: Displays a message box with an input field. It returns the value entered by the user or `null` if the user cancels.

15. **What is the use of `void(0)`?**
The `void(0)` expression is used in JavaScript to prevent the browser from taking any action when a link or button is clicked. It essentially evaluates the expression `0` and returns `undefined`. It is often used in `href` attributes of anchor tags when you want a click to have no effect.

16. **How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?**
To force a page to load another page in JavaScript, you can set the `window.location` property to the URL of the desired page. For example:

```javascript
window.location = "https://example.com/newpage.html";
```

17. **What are the disadvantages of using `innerHTML` in JavaScript?**
While `innerHTML` is a convenient way to manipulate the content of an element, it has some potential drawbacks:
- Security risk: If you're inserting user-generated content into the HTML using `innerHTML`, it can expose your web application to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Performance impact: Modifying `innerHTML` can be slower than other methods, especially when dealing with large amounts of content, as it requires parsing and updating the entire HTML structure within the element.
- Overwriting event handlers: When using `innerHTML` to update the content of an element, any event handlers attached to the previous content will be lost, requiring you to reattach them manually.
- Limited support for SVG and MathML: `innerHTML` may not work as expected when dealing with SVG or MathML content, as it is primarily designed for HTML manipulation.
