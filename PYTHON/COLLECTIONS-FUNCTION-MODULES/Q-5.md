# How to Compare Two list In Python

## To Compare Two List In Python, We Can Use Various Method Depending On Our Specific Requirment

### Method Elements-Wise Comparesion

### Check if each elements in one list is equal to the correponding elements in other list.

```
EXAMPLE

<!-- DEFINE TWO LIST -->
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = [1,2,3,4,5]

<!-- check if the list are equal elements-wise -->

result = all(x==y for x,y in zip(list1,list2))

if result:
   print("The List Are Equal")
else:
   print("List Are Not Equal)
```

### Set Comparison

### Converts list to set and check for equality.This Approach ignores the order of the elements.

```
<!-- Example -->

list1=[1,2,3]
list1=[1,2,3]

result = set(list1) == set(list2)

print(result)


```
