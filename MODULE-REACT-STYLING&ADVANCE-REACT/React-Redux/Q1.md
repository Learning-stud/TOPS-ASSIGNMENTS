## (Q-01) What is Redux?

# Redux Overview

Redux is a popular state management library for React.js applications. It plays a crucial role in managing application state in a predictable and centralized manner, making it easier to handle complex state management in large applications. Here are the core concepts of Redux:

## Store

Redux maintains a single centralized store that holds the entire application's state. This store is typically represented as an object tree, reflecting the current state of your application.

## Actions

Actions in Redux are plain JavaScript objects that represent events or user interactions capable of changing the application's state. Actions must include a `type` property to describe the type of action being performed.

## Reducers

Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state should change in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as input and return a new state. Reducers are responsible for updating the store with the new state.

## Dispatch

To trigger a state change, you dispatch an action to the Redux store using the `store.dispatch(action)` method. Redux then calls the appropriate reducer, which updates the state accordingly.

## Subscribe

You can subscribe to changes in the Redux store using `store.subscribe(listener)`. This feature enables your components to be notified whenever the state changes, allowing them to update their user interfaces accordingly.

## Middleware

Redux allows the use of middleware to handle side effects, such as asynchronous actions. Popular middleware libraries like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga can be utilized to manage complex asynchronous logic effectively.

Redux is commonly used in conjunction with React.js, particularly in large and complex applications, to streamline state management and enhance maintainability.
