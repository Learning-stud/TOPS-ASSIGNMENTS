# Functional Component with Hooks Life Cycle

Functional components with Hooks do not have a traditional life cycle like class components. Instead, they have functional hooks that allow you to manage state and side effects.

1. **State Hook (`useState`):** Initialize and manage component state.

2. **Effect Hook (`useEffect`):** Handle side effects, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation.
   - `useEffect` can replicate the behavior of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` depending on how you use it.

Functional components with Hooks provide a more concise and readable way to manage component logic compared to the traditional class component life cycle methods.

Remember that the exact behavior may vary depending on how you use these hooks and manage your component's state and effects. It's important to understand the specific use cases of each hook and how they work together to manage your component's behavior.

# Class Component Life Cycle

1. **Initialization (constructor):** This is where the component is initialized with default props and state. The constructor is called only once during the component's lifecycle.

2. **Mounting Phase:**

   - `componentWillMount` (deprecated): This is called right before the component will be mounted to the DOM.
   - `render`: This method is responsible for rendering the component's UI.
   - `componentDidMount`: This is called after the component has been mounted to the DOM. It's often used for data fetching and setting up subscriptions.

3. **Updating Phase:**

   - `shouldComponentUpdate`: This method is called before rendering when new props or state are received. It can be used to optimize rendering by determining if a re-render is necessary.
   - `componentWillUpdate` (deprecated): Called just before rendering when new props or state are received.
   - `render`: Re-renders the component.
   - `componentDidUpdate`: Called after the component updates and the changes are reflected in the DOM.

4. **Unmounting Phase:**

   - `componentWillUnmount`: Called just before the component is unmounted and removed from the DOM. Used for cleanup tasks like removing event listeners.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - `componentDidCatch`: Introduced in React 16, this method is called when an error occurs during rendering in the component tree below this one. It's used for error boundaries.
